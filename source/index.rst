    Beautiful is better than ugly. <beautiful-is-better-than-ugly.rst>
    Explicit is better than implicit. <explicit-is-better-than-implicit.rst>
    Simple is better than complex. <simple-is-better-than-complex.rst>
    Complex is better than complicated. <complex-is-better-than-complicated.rst>
    Flat is better than nested. <flat-is-better-than-nested.rst>
    Sparse is better than dense. <sparse-is-better-than-dense.rst>
    Readability counts. <readability-counts.rst>
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <special-cases-are-not-special.rst>
    Although practicality beats purity. <practicality-beats-purity.rst>
    Errors should never pass silently. <errors-should-never-pass-silently.rst>
    Unless explicitly silenced. <errors-should-never-pass-silently.rst>
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <refuse-the-tempation-to-guess.rst>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. <one-obvious-way.rst>
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. <one-obvious-way.rst>
    Now is better than never. <now-is-better-than-never.rst>
    Although never is often better than *right* now. <never-is-better-than-right-now.rst>
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <hard-to-explain-is-a-bad-idea.rst>
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <easy-to-explain-maybe-good-idea.rst>
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! <namespaces.rst>

The Zen of Python is officially documented in `PEP 20`_ by Tim Peters.

This site was inspired by `David Gouldin's tweet`_ at the lazyweb, though it
deviates somewhat from his original specification. The site is built with
Sphinx_ and uses Ryan Roemer's `Sphinx Bootstrap Theme`_. It was compiled by
`Vince Veselosky`_ and is hosted at Github_.

Also, for managing the annoyingly tricky gh-pages branch, I use Paul Davis's
ghp-import_ tool, which makes life so much easier.
