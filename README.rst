Zen of Python
=========================================
This is a simple web site that provides linkable versions of each of the tenets
of the Zen of Python.

The Zen of Python is officially documented in `PEP 20`_ by Tim Peters.

This site was inspired by `David Gouldin's tweet`_ at the lazyweb, though it
deviates somewhat from his original specification. The site is built with
Sphinx_ and uses Ryan Roemer's `Sphinx Bootstrap Theme`_. It was compiled by
`Vince Veselosky`_ and is hosted at Github.
